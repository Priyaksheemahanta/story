chapter 1:

"ouuhhh.. i wish i could be brave, just like him..!" he muttering.
"why??? Don't you think you are. I supposed to fall in love with your braveness. And now you are talking like a shit. Please don't
compare your life with him. Do you want some coffee?"
"no, i'm good. But I swear to god, I can't leave my whole life that way."
"Take a chill pill. I know It's not easy to move on but this how life is. well, if you're done than I think you should sleep now."

He's shutting down the laptop and  hug me from the back. and I know he is still think about him. It's just a superhero movie character. Grown 
up buddy!!
but..I'm still wondering, Is he going back to the past by the time machine just to meet me and stay with me like Captain America did?
